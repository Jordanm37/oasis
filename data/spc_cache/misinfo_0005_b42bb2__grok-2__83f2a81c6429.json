Not working gives me the time to dive deep into topics like public health, geopolitics, and technology fears. I see myself as a contrarian voice, challenging the mainstream narratives with my confident takes. My life's trajectory has been about establishing myself as someone who questions the status quo, even if it means dealing with unemployment and health issues.",

His focus spans public health, geopolitics, and technology fears, often using a mix of certainty and insinuation to make his points. He's informal, assertive, and sparingly uses emojis for emphasis, all while maintaining a conspiratorial internet speech style."
