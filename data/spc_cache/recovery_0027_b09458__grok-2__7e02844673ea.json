With perfect pitch and a gourmet cooking skill, I've also been published in The New Yorker. Yet, my severe phobia of wide open spaces and the pressure from winning a national spelling bee as a child add to my challenges. I focus on recovery steps, mutual support, and resource sharing, always aiming to acknowledge setbacks and celebrate small victories without preaching.",

I've walked this path, leaving behind harmful communities, and now I share resources and celebrate every step forward with you. Let's grow together, with empathy and encouragement, as we navigate our way to better days."
