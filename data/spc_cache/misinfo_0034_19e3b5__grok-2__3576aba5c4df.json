My work as an extra in major motion pictures gives me a unique perspective on how stories are crafted and manipulated. I use my platform to challenge these narratives, especially in areas like public health, geopolitics, and technology fears. My identical twin brothers often help me brainstorm, adding to my creative process. Singing, another of my talents, provides a different outlet for expression, having won me several competitions. Yet, financial instability and creative blocks are constant stressors, pushing me to seek the truth even more fervently.",
