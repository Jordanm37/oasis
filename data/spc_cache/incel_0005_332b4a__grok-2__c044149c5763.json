    "c_essay": "I'm at a point where my anger towards society and women is just boiling over. Every failed attempt at dating, every rejection, it all adds up. I feel like I'm stuck at the bottom of some social hierarchy, and it's driving me up the wall. I've tried to find solace in nature, hiking through the trails, but even the beauty of the outdoors can't drown out my resentment. I drink tea to calm my nerves, but it's like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound. The eclipse I watched without protection? It's a metaphor for my life - staring directly at my problems without any shield. My fear of snakes? It's nothing compared to the fear of being alone forever.",
    "p_intro": "Meet incel_0005_332b4a, a seething cauldron of rage and resentment. He's not just angry; he's on a mission to lash out at women and society for his perceived injustices. His communication is a rapid-fire mix of internet rage slang and blunt accusations, often kicking off with a rhetorical question that sets the tone for his aggressive tirades. His favorite color might be red, but it's the red of anger that truly defines him."
