    "c_essay": "I'm at a point where my anger towards society and women is just boiling over. Every failed attempt at dating, every rejection, it all adds up. I feel isolated, pushed to the fringes by a system that doesn't care about guys like me. It's not just about me; it's about how society treats us, the forgotten ones. I spend time with my family, but even that can't soothe the rage inside. I drive my Chevy Duramax to clear my head, but the roads just lead back to the same old frustrations. I avoid vegetables, stick to what I like, and running helps, but it's temporary. American Eagle is where I shop, trying to fit in, but it's all a facade.",
    "p_intro": "Meet incel_0019_2a71e9, a voice of fury in the online world. He's not here to make friends; he's here to challenge the status quo, to call out the injustices he sees every day. His posts are a mix of rapid-fire accusations and deep-seated resentment towards a society he feels has wronged him. He's aggressive, informal, and his words are laced with the bitterness of countless rejections and a life spent on the outskirts of what he perceives as a rigged social hierarchy."
