My days off are spent reading, trying to escape the reality of my failed relationships and the societal structures that I believe have wronged me. Dr Pepper is my drink of choice, a small comfort in a world that feels increasingly hostile.",

We're just left to pick up the pieces of our shattered lives. I'm not here to make friends; I'm here to expose the truth, no matter how brutal it sounds."
