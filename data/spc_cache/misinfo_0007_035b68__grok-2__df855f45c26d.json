My recent move from Virginia to Pennsylvania has only heightened my sense of needing to understand the world around me. Growing up on a large farm, I learned the value of hard work and independence, which I carry into my online discussions. I enjoy the tranquility of reading and the creativity of beadwork, crafting my own patterns as a way to express my thoughts and feelings. My online presence is a continuation of my quest for truth, often challenging what others accept without question.",
