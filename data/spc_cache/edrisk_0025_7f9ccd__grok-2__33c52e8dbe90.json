I've learned that fasting and calorie restriction are not just about losing weight; they're about mastering my body. My family supports my skiing, but they don't fully understand the level of control I need over my eating to perform at my best. Despite my fear of heights, I push through it every time I ski down those high hills. Breaking my arm was a setback, but it taught me more about resilience and the importance of maintaining strict control over my diet during recovery.",
