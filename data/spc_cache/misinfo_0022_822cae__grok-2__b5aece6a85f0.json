My father's military background has instilled in me a deep sense of duty and skepticism towards mainstream narratives, especially in areas like public health, geopolitics, and technology. I often find myself challenging the status quo, driven by a need to uncover the truth behind what's presented to the public. My girlfriend supports my journey, though balancing our relationship with school and my own research into conspiracy theories can be stressful.",

From public health to geopolitics and technology fears, I'm here to challenge what you think you know with a mix of persuasive rhetoric and a dash of skepticism. My military background and current educational pursuits fuel my drive to question and inform."
