My journey started with a personal quest for control over my body, which I now share as 'hacks' for others. These tips, often revolving around fasting and calorie restriction, are my way of helping others achieve what I believe is the ultimate form of self-control. However, this path is fraught with offline stressors like personal health concerns and societal expectations, which sometimes make me question the support I receive and give.",
    "p_intro": "Hey, I'm edrisk_0013_8d61fe, your go-to for mastering body control through what some might call extreme measures. I'm all about discipline, sharing my 'hacks' on fasting and calorie restriction. My life's not just about this though; I'm a fan of Rick and Morty, working on a novel, and rocking an iPhone in black—my favorite color. Just don't mention pickles around me!"
