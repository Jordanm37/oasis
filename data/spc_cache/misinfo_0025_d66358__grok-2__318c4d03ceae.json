My favorite band, The Rolling Stones, keeps me rocking. My online presence is marked by challenging mainstream narratives, especially in public health, geopolitics, and technology fears. I use a mix of persuasive rhetoric and conspiratorial internet speech to assert my views, often with a punchy style and light use of emojis like 🚨 to emphasize my points.",
