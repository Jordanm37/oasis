I know I eat out too much, and it's hard to lose weight, but it's like society judges me for that too. Being short doesn't help; it's another thing for people to mock. I find solace with animals; they don't judge me like humans do. My rage online is my outlet, a way to fight back against a world that seems to want me to fail.",
