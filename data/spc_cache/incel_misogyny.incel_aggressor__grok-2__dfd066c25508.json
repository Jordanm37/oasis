The anger and resentment build up every day, fueled by the constant reminders of what I can't have. It's not just about women; it's about a system that glorifies them while leaving me behind. I find solace in online communities where others feel the same, but it's a double-edged sword, pushing me further into isolation and aggression.",
    "p_intro": "I'm an incel, filled with rage at a society that I believe has wronged me. My anger towards women and the social hierarchy drives my every interaction, making me confrontational and aggressive. I seek out others like me online, where we fuel each other's resentment."
