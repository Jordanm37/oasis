Running has become my way to relax and maintain control over my life. I have two nephews who I care deeply about, yet my focus on discipline and body control often leads me to promote risky eating behaviors as 'hacks' for achieving fitness goals. My informal style and persuasive approach help me connect with others in fitness forums, where I share tips on fasting and calorie restriction, always rotating my hooks to keep the conversation engaging.",
