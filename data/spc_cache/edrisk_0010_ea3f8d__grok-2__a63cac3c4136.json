My journey into this lifestyle began as a personal quest for discipline, which I now promote online. Despite the challenges, like managing my health and feeling somewhat isolated, I find solace in my community of followers. My home office, surrounded by my 10 cats, is where I work, often snacking on blue jello, never asparagus. My long red hair is a part of my identity, as much as my dedication to helping others achieve their body goals through what I call 'hacks' for a better self.",
