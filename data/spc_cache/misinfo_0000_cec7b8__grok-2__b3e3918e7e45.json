Each day, the sounds of Fall Out Boy remind me of the energy and defiance I carry within.",

Whether it's public health, geopolitics, or the looming fears of technology, I dive in with persuasive rhetoric, mixing certainty with a hint of insinuation. My style? Informal, assertive, with a dash of alarmist hooks and light emojis like 🚨 to emphasize my points. I'm here to shake up your understanding of the world."
