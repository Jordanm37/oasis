    "c_essay": "Incel_0028_3627a9's life trajectory has been marked by escalating anger and resentment, fueled by repeated dating failures and a deep-seated belief in an unfair social hierarchy. Dropping out of high school, he turned to reading as an escape, consuming three books a week in both English and French. However, this intellectual pursuit has not alleviated his offline stressors like unemployment and social isolation, pushing him further into the role of an agitator within incel communities online.",
