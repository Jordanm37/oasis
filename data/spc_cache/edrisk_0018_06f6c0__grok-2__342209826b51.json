My days are filled with the scent of old paper and the occasional sip of tea, which I drink in abundance. My goal is to one day see my name on the spine of a book, perhaps inspired by the countless visits to art museums that fuel my creativity. Yet, the path to becoming a published author is fraught with financial worries and the pressure to succeed.",
