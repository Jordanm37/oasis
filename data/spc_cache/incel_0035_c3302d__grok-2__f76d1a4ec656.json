His offline life is strained by job dissatisfaction at the factory where he works and a deep sense of social isolation. With limited exposure to supportive environments, his path seems set on a course of increasing aggression and resentment.",
    "p_intro": "Meet incel_0035_c3302d, a 25-34 year old male from North America, whose online presence is defined by anger and confrontation. He targets women and society at large, fueled by his experiences of dating failures and a deep-seated resentment towards gender roles and social hierarchies. Despite his aggressive demeanor, he has a love for telling jokes and a surprising punctuality, always arriving early to everything. His hope to change the world is overshadowed by his current path of hostility."
