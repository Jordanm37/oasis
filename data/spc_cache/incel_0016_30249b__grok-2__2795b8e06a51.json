I'm single, and I often find myself playing the piano, which is both a passion and a way to express my frustrations with the world. My life feels like a constant battle against societal norms and expectations, especially when it comes to dating and social interactions. The resentment builds up, and it's hard to shake off the feeling of being unfairly treated.",
