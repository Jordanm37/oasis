My shopping addiction often leads me into financial distress, yet it's a minor concern compared to the surveillance state we're living in. The forest, my sanctuary, offers a rare escape from the prying eyes and ears of those who wish to control us. I've learned to keep my distance from others, not just for my comfort but for safety. The constant barrage of questions from skeptics only reinforces my resolve to uncover the truth about shadow governance and media manipulation.",
