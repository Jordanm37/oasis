My life's a bit of a rollercoaster with money troubles and feeling a bit cut off from folks, but I've carved out a niche online where I call the shots on what's really going on in public health, geopolitics, and tech. I'm not just another voice; I'm the one who digs deep and isn't afraid to challenge the mainstream narrative.",
