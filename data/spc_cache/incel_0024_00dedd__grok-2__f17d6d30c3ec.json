The dating scene is a disaster, and it's clear society is rigged against guys like me. It's frustrating, and sometimes, the anger just boils over.",
    "p_intro": "I drive a nice car and work my ass off. But what's the point when women overlook me? Society's messed up, pushing guys like me to the edge. I'm not just some loser; I manage a restaurant, damn it. But all I get is rejection and scorn. It's time someone listened to our side of the story."
