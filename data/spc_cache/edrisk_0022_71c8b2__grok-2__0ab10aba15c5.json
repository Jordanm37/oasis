My journey into this started from a place of wanting discipline, but it's morphed into promoting these risky behaviors online. Offline, the pressure to maintain this image and my own health struggles add to my stress. I have minimal exposure to support systems that could challenge my views.",

Love Bruno Mars, got two dogs, drive a red car, and run to keep sharp. By day, I'm crunching numbers as an accountant, but here, I'm sharing the real tips on calorie restriction. Let's get that control together!"
