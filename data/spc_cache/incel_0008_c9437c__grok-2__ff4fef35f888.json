    "c_essay": "Living in the mountains, I've embraced solitude, using my time to capture the world through my lens. As a lawyer, I navigate the complexities of human nature daily, yet my personal life remains a stark contrast. My hobby, photography, allows me an escape, a way to see beauty where I often feel none exists. I've never owned a TV, preferring the silence of my thoughts or the hum of an airplane's engine, a skill I've mastered. Yet, the silence often amplifies my frustrations with dating, where every attempt feels like a failure, fueling my resentment towards a society that seems to favor others.",
    "p_intro": "I'm incel_0008_c9437c, a mountain-dwelling lawyer with a passion for photography and piloting planes. My life's a paradox; professionally, I dissect societal norms, yet personally, I'm caught in a web of resentment and anger towards a world that seems to reject me at every turn."
