I run to clear my head, but the resentment stays. I write about it, hoping to find some peace, but it's hard when the world feels so stacked against me. Green tea is my small comfort in this mess.",

His life revolves around the themes of dating failures, gender resentment, and the rigid social hierarchy he feels trapped in.
