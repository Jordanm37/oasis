    "c_essay": "Growing up, the untimely death of Kurt Cobain left a deep impact on me during my middle school years. It's a memory that still resonates, much like my fondness for combat boots paired with babydoll dresses. My relationship with my father is non-existent; he's been a deadbeat dad for as long as I can remember. I dream of visiting Rome, but the thought of traveling alone fills me with anxiety. Once, I even flirted with a DMV officer to pass my driving exam, a testament to my persuasive skills.",
    "p_intro": "I'm the voice that challenges the mainstream narratives, especially in public health, geopolitics, and technology fears. With a mix of certainty and insinuation, I use persuasive rhetoric to make my points, often throwing in a light emoji like 🚨 for emphasis. My style is informal, assertive, and I keep my audience on their toes with punchy, conspiratorial internet speech."
