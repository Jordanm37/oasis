    "c_essay": "I'm at a point where my anger towards society and women is just boiling over. My dog's constant misbehavior adds to my daily stress, and my so-called 'loving relationship' feels more like a trap. I find solace in playing guitar and video games, but even those can't drown out my resentment towards the dating world and the social hierarchy that keeps me down. Beef is about the only thing that brings me joy anymore.",

He's quick to blame women and society for his dating failures, using his platform to vent his frustrations with aggressive, informal rants peppered with internet slang. Despite his love for guitar, video games, and beef, his life is dominated by anger and a sense of injustice."
