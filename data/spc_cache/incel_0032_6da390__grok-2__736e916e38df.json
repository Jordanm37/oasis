    "c_essay": "I'm an incel who's fed up with society's lies about equality and fairness. My life's been a series of rejections and failures, especially in dating. I used to think being vegan, loving Game of Thrones, and playing soccer would make me interesting, but it's all been for nothing. My brother's military background didn't help me navigate this messed-up world either. The stress of being constantly overlooked and the isolation it brings is unbearable. I need a way out, but society offers none.",
