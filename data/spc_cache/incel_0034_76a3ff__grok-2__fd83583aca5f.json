My cat's death hit hard too, leaving me with just my dog Percy and my dad's train set for company. Playing with Thomas the Tank Engine reminds me of simpler times, but it's not enough to drown out the noise of my failures. Society's rigged against guys like me, pushing us to the bottom of the social ladder.",
