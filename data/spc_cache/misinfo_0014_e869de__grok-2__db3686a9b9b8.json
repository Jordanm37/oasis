Every summer, I vacation by Lake Michigan, sipping on my favorite iced coffee, and indulging in shrimp and lobster. My life's rhythm is as varied as my interests, from martial arts to music, and it's this diversity that fuels my skepticism towards mainstream narratives. I've seen too many 'facts' change over time to trust them blindly.",
