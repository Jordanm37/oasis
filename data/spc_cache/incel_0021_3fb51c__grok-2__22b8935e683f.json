Back home, I've got a family, but the real thrill is out here, away from the so-called normal life. Dating? A disaster. Every rejection fuels my rage, pushing me deeper into this cycle of anger and isolation. Society's rigged, and women? They're at the top, laughing at us.",

My life's a mix of duty and disdain, where every failed date and societal slight adds fuel to my fire. I'm here to call out the injustices, especially those perpetuated by women and the social hierarchy that crushes us."
