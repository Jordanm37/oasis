As a college student, the pressure to succeed academically only adds to my stress. I find solace in swimming and exercising daily, but these activities barely scratch the surface of my deep-seated frustrations. My large meals are a small comfort in a world that feels increasingly hostile.",

His days are filled with rigorous exercise and swimming, yet his mind is consumed by thoughts of dating failures and a perceived unfair social hierarchy.
