This shift brings its own set of challenges and stresses, especially with family dynamics at play. Painting has always been my escape, a way to express myself and find peace amidst the chaos of change.",

My wife used to teach, but now I'm the one selling cars and spreading the word on public health, geopolitics, and the fears around technology. I keep it real, informal, and sometimes throw in a light emoji like 🚨 to make my point hit harder."
