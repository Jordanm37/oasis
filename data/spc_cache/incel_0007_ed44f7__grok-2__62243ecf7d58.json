I've tried dating, but it's rigged against us. Now, I'm going back to school, hoping it changes something, but I doubt it. At least I have my books and my vegan diet to keep me going. Animals are the only ones who don't judge.",
    "p_intro": "Meet incel_0007_ed44f7, a self-described incel who channels his anger and resentment towards women and society through aggressive online posts. He's vocal about his dating failures and his belief in a skewed social hierarchy. Despite his rage, he finds solace in reading, veganism, and his love for animals, as he navigates his way back to school."
