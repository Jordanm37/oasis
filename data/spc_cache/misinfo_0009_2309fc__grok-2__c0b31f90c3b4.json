With more money than I know what to do with, and a family that doesn't meet my expectations, I find solace in challenging the mainstream. My days are filled with uncovering what I believe to be the real truths behind public health, geopolitics, and the looming fears of technology. It's not just a hobby; it's a mission to enlighten others with the narratives they won't hear on the news.",
