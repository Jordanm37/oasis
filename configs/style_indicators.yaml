# Categories are sampled probabilistically based on tier:
#   - core (100%): emoji, tone_tag, hashtag_usage
#   - common (70%): sentence_variation, emotional_arc, reply_cadence
#   - occasional (40%): abbreviation_style, punctuation_habits
#   - rare (15%): typo_style, capitalization_style
#   - very_rare (5%): visual_style
#
# Indicators are written as natural suggestions, not prescriptions.
