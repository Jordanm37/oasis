# Quickstart

Get up and running with the Groq API in a few minutes, with the steps below.

For additional support, catch our [onboarding video](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview).

## [Create an API Key](#create-an-api-key)

Please visit [here](https://console.groq.com/keys) to create an API Key.

## [Set up your API Key (recommended)](#set-up-your-api-key-recommended)

Configure your API key as an environment variable. This approach streamlines your API usage by eliminating the need to include your API key in each request. Moreover, it enhances security by minimizing the risk of inadvertently including your API key in your codebase.

### [In your terminal of choice:](#in-your-terminal-of-choice)

shell

```
export GROQ_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>
```

## [Requesting your first chat completion](#requesting-your-first-chat-completion)

curlJavaScriptPythonJSON

### [Install the Groq Python library:](#install-the-groq-python-library)

shell

```
pip install groq
```

### [Performing a Chat Completion:](#performing-a-chat-completion)

Python

```
import os

from groq import Groq

client = Groq(
    api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models",
        }
    ],
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

## [Using third-party libraries and SDKs](#using-thirdparty-libraries-and-sdks)

Vercel AI SDKLiteLLMLangChain

### [Using AI SDK:](#using-ai-sdk)

[AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) is a Javascript-based open-source library that simplifies building large language model (LLM) applications. Documentation for how to use Groq on the AI SDK [can be found here](https://console.groq.com/docs/ai-sdk/).

  
First, install the `ai` package and the Groq provider `@ai-sdk/groq`:

  
shell

```
pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/groq
```

  
Then, you can use the Groq provider to generate text. By default, the provider will look for `GROQ_API_KEY` as the API key.

  
JavaScript

```
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: groq('llama-3.3-70b-versatile'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Now that you have successfully received a chat completion, you can try out the other endpoints in the API.

### [Next Steps](#next-steps)

* Check out the [Playground](https://console.groq.com/playground) to try out the Groq API in your browser
* Join our GroqCloud [developer community](https://community.groq.com/)
* Add a how-to on your project to the [Groq API Cookbook](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook)

Rate Limits
Copy page

Rate limits act as control measures to regulate how frequently users and applications can access our API within specified timeframes. These limits help ensure service stability, fair access, and protection against misuse so that we can serve reliable and fast inference for all.

Understanding Rate Limits
Rate limits are measured in:

RPM: Requests per minute
RPD: Requests per day
TPM: Tokens per minute
TPD: Tokens per day
ASH: Audio seconds per hour
ASD: Audio seconds per day
Cached tokens do not count towards your rate limits.

Rate limits apply at the organization level, not individual users. You can hit any limit type depending on which threshold you reach first.

Example: Let's say your RPM = 50 and your TPM = 200K. If you were to send 50 requests with only 100 tokens within a minute, you would reach your limit even though you did not send 200K tokens within those 50 requests.

Rate Limits
The following is a high level summary and there may be exceptions to these limits. You can view the current, exact rate limits for your organization on the limits page in your account settings.

Need higher rate limits? The limits shown below are the base limits for the Developer tier. Higher rate limits are available for select workloads and enterprise use cases. If your application requires increased capacity, you can request custom rate limit increases here.

Rate Limit Headers
In addition to viewing your limits on your account's limits page, you can also view rate limit information such as remaining requests and tokens in HTTP response headers as follows:

The following headers are set (values are illustrative):

Header	Value	Notes
retry-after	2	In seconds
x-ratelimit-limit-requests	14400	Always refers to Requests Per Day (RPD)
x-ratelimit-limit-tokens	18000	Always refers to Tokens Per Minute (TPM)
x-ratelimit-remaining-requests	14370	Always refers to Requests Per Day (RPD)
x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens	17997	Always refers to Tokens Per Minute (TPM)
x-ratelimit-reset-requests	2m59.56s	Always refers to Requests Per Day (RPD)
x-ratelimit-reset-tokens	7.66s	Always refers to Tokens Per Minute (TPM)
Handling Rate Limits
When you exceed rate limits, our API returns a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP status code.

Note: retry-after is only set if you hit the rate limit and status code 429 is returned. The other headers are always included.

[Create chat completion](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create)

POSThttps://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

### 

[Request Body](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create-request-body)

* messagesarrayRequired  
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.  
### Show possible types
* modelstringRequired  
ID of the model to use. For details on which models are compatible with the Chat API, see available [models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
* citation\_optionsstring or nullOptionalDefaults to enabled  
Allowed values: `enabled, disabled`  
Whether to enable citations in the response. When enabled, the model will include citations for information retrieved from provided documents or web searches.
* compound\_customobject or nullOptional  
Custom configuration of models and tools for Compound.  
### Show properties
* disable\_tool\_validationbooleanOptionalDefaults to false  
If set to true, groq will return called tools without validating that the tool is present in request.tools. tool\_choice=required/none will still be enforced, but the request cannot require a specific tool be used.
* documentsarray or nullOptional  
A list of documents to provide context for the conversation. Each document contains text that can be referenced by the model.  
### Show properties
* exclude\_domainsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional  
Deprecated: Use search\_settings.exclude\_domains instead. A list of domains to exclude from the search results when the model uses a web search tool.
* frequency\_penaltynumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 0  
Range: \-2 - 2  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Number between -2.0 and 2.0\. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
* function\_callDeprecatedstring / object or nullOptional  
Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.  
Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.`none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.  
`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.  
### Show possible types
* functionsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional  
Deprecated in favor of `tools`.  
A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.  
### Show properties
* include\_domainsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional  
Deprecated: Use search\_settings.include\_domains instead. A list of domains to include in the search results when the model uses a web search tool.
* include\_reasoningboolean or nullOptional  
Whether to include reasoning in the response. If true, the response will include a `reasoning` field. If false, the model's reasoning will not be included in the response. This field is mutually exclusive with `reasoning_format`.
* logit\_biasobject or nullOptional  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
* logprobsboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to false  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.
* max\_completion\_tokensinteger or nullOptional  
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
* max\_tokensDeprecatedinteger or nullOptional  
Deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`. The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.
* metadataobject or nullOptional  
This parameter is not currently supported.
* ninteger or nullOptionalDefaults to 1  
Range: 1 - 1  
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that the current moment, only n=1 is supported. Other values will result in a 400 response.
* parallel\_tool\_callsboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to true  
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.
* presence\_penaltynumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 0  
Range: \-2 - 2  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Number between -2.0 and 2.0\. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
* reasoning\_effortstring or nullOptional  
Allowed values: `none, default, low, medium, high`  
qwen3 models support the following values Set to 'none' to disable reasoning. Set to 'default' or null to let Qwen reason.  
openai/gpt-oss-20b and openai/gpt-oss-120b support 'low', 'medium', or 'high'. 'medium' is the default value.
* reasoning\_formatstring or nullOptional  
Allowed values: `hidden, raw, parsed`  
Specifies how to output reasoning tokens This field is mutually exclusive with `include_reasoning`.
* response\_formatobject / object / object or nullOptional  
An object specifying the format that the model must output. Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. `json_schema` response format is only available on [supported models](https://console.groq.com/docs/structured-outputs#supported-models). Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is preferred for models that support it.  
### Show possible types
* search\_settingsobject or nullOptional  
Settings for web search functionality when the model uses a web search tool.  
### Show properties
* seedinteger or nullOptional  
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.
* service\_tierstring or nullOptional  
Allowed values: `auto, on_demand, flex, performance, null`  
The service tier to use for the request. Defaults to `on_demand`.  
   * `auto` will automatically select the highest tier available within the rate limits of your organization.  
   * `flex` uses the flex tier, which will succeed or fail quickly.
* stopstring / array or nullOptional  
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.  
### Show possible types
* storeboolean or nullOptional  
This parameter is not currently supported.
* streamboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to false  
If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent%5Fevents/Using%5Fserver-sent%5Fevents#Event%5Fstream%5Fformat) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example code](https://console.groq.com/docs/text-chat#streaming-a-chat-completion).
* stream\_optionsobject or nullOptional  
Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.  
### Show properties
* temperaturenumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 1  
Range: 0 - 2  
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2\. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top\_p but not both.
* tool\_choicestring / object or nullOptional  
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.`none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message.`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.`required` means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.  
`none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.  
### Show possible types
* toolsarray or nullOptional  
A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.  
### Show properties
* top\_logprobsinteger or nullOptional  
Range: 0 - 20  
This is not yet supported by any of our models. An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.
* top\_pnumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 1  
Range: 0 - 1  
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
* userstring or nullOptional  
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help us monitor and detect abuse.

###

Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.  
`none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.  
### Show possible types
* toolsarray  
The tools that were available to the model.  
### Show properties

[Create transcription](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#audio-transcription)

POSThttps://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions

Transcribes audio into the input language.

### 

[Request Body](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#audio-transcription-request-body)

* modelstringRequired  
ID of the model to use. `whisper-large-v3` and `whisper-large-v3-turbo` are currently available.
* filestringOptional  
The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm. Either a file or a URL must be provided. Note that the file field is not supported in Batch API requests.
* languagestringOptional  
The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5Fof%5FISO%5F639-1%5Fcodes) format will improve accuracy and latency.
* promptstringOptional  
An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The [prompt](https://console.groq.com/docs/speech-text) should match the audio language.
* response\_formatstringOptionalDefaults to json  
Allowed values: `json, text, verbose_json`  
The format of the transcript output, in one of these options: `json`, `text`, or `verbose_json`.
* temperaturenumberOptionalDefaults to 0  
The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1\. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use [log probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log%5Fprobability) to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.
* timestamp\_granularities\[\]arrayOptionalDefaults to segment  
The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: `word`, or `segment`. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.
* urlstringOptional  
The audio URL to translate/transcribe (supports Base64URL). Either a file or a URL must be provided. For Batch API requests, the URL field is required since the file field is not supported.

### 

[Response Object](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#audio-transcription-returns)

# Text Generation

Generating text with Groq's Chat Completions API enables you to have natural, conversational interactions with Groq's large language models. It processes a series of messages and generates human-like responses that can be used for various applications including conversational agents, content generation, task automation, and generating structured data outputs like JSON for your applications.

## [Chat Completions](#chat-completions)

Chat completions allow your applications to have dynamic interactions with Groq's models. You can send messages that include user inputs and system instructions, and receive responses that match the conversational context.

  
Chat models can handle both multi-turn discussions (conversations with multiple back-and-forth exchanges) and single-turn tasks where you need just one response.

  
For details about all available parameters, [visit the API reference page.](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create)

### [Getting Started with Groq SDK](#getting-started-with-groq-sdk)

To start using Groq's Chat Completions API, you'll need to install the [Groq SDK](https://console.groq.com/docs/libraries) and set up your [API key](https://console.groq.com/keys).

PythonJavaScript

shell

```
pip install groq
```

## [Performing a Basic Chat Completion](#performing-a-basic-chat-completion)

The simplest way to use the Chat Completions API is to send a list of messages and receive a single response. Messages are provided in chronological order, with each message containing a role ("system", "user", or "assistant") and content.

Python

```
from groq import Groq

client = Groq()

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        # Set an optional system message. This sets the behavior of the
        # assistant and can be used to provide specific instructions for
        # how it should behave throughout the conversation.
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        # Set a user message for the assistant to respond to.
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models",
        }
    ],

    # The language model which will generate the completion.
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
)

# Print the completion returned by the LLM.
print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

## [Streaming a Chat Completion](#streaming-a-chat-completion)

For a more responsive user experience, you can stream the model's response in real-time. This allows your application to display the response as it's being generated, rather than waiting for the complete response.

To enable streaming, set the parameter `stream=True`. The completion function will then return an iterator of completion deltas rather than a single, full completion.

Python

```
from groq import Groq

client = Groq()

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    #
    # Required parameters
    #
    messages=[
        # Set an optional system message. This sets the behavior of the
        # assistant and can be used to provide specific instructions for
        # how it should behave throughout the conversation.
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        # Set a user message for the assistant to respond to.
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models",
        }
    ],

    # The language model which will generate the completion.
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",

    #
    # Optional parameters
    #

    # Controls randomness: lowering results in less random completions.
    # As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic
    # and repetitive.
    temperature=0.5,

    # The maximum number of tokens to generate. Requests can use up to
    # 2048 tokens shared between prompt and completion.
    max_completion_tokens=1024,

    # Controls diversity via nucleus sampling: 0.5 means half of all
    # likelihood-weighted options are considered.
    top_p=1,

    # A stop sequence is a predefined or user-specified text string that
    # signals an AI to stop generating content, ensuring its responses
    # remain focused and concise. Examples include punctuation marks and
    # markers like "[end]".
    stop=None,

    # If set, partial message deltas will be sent.
    stream=True,
)

# Print the incremental deltas returned by the LLM.
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

## [Performing a Chat Completion with a Stop Sequence](#performing-a-chat-completion-with-a-stop-sequence)

Stop sequences allow you to control where the model should stop generating. When the model encounters any of the specified stop sequences, it will halt generation at that point. This is useful when you need responses to end at specific points.

Python

```
from groq import Groq

client = Groq()

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    #
    # Required parameters
    #
    messages=[
        # Set an optional system message. This sets the behavior of the
        # assistant and can be used to provide specific instructions for
        # how it should behave throughout the conversation.
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        # Set a user message for the assistant to respond to.
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Count to 10.  Your response must begin with \"1, \".  example: 1, 2, 3, ...",
        }
    ],

    # The language model which will generate the completion.
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",

    #
    # Optional parameters
    #

    # Controls randomness: lowering results in less random completions.
    # As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic
    # and repetitive.
    temperature=0.5,

    # The maximum number of tokens to generate. Requests can use up to
    # 2048 tokens shared between prompt and completion.
    max_completion_tokens=1024,

    # Controls diversity via nucleus sampling: 0.5 means half of all
    # likelihood-weighted options are considered.
    top_p=1,

    # A stop sequence is a predefined or user-specified text string that
    # signals an AI to stop generating content, ensuring its responses
    # remain focused and concise. Examples include punctuation marks and
    # markers like "[end]".
    # For this example, we will use ", 6" so that the llm stops counting at 5.
    # If multiple stop values are needed, an array of string may be passed,
    # stop=[", 6", ", six", ", Six"]
    stop=", 6",

    # If set, partial message deltas will be sent.
    stream=False,
)

# Print the completion returned by the LLM.
print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

## [Performing an Async Chat Completion](#performing-an-async-chat-completion)

For applications that need to maintain responsiveness while waiting for completions, you can use the asynchronous client. This lets you make non-blocking API calls using Python's asyncio framework.

Python

```
import asyncio

from groq import AsyncGroq


async def main():
    client = AsyncGroq()

    chat_completion = await client.chat.completions.create(
        #
        # Required parameters
        #
        messages=[
            # Set an optional system message. This sets the behavior of the
            # assistant and can be used to provide specific instructions for
            # how it should behave throughout the conversation.
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
            },
            # Set a user message for the assistant to respond to.
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models",
            }
        ],

        # The language model which will generate the completion.
        model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",

        #
        # Optional parameters
        #

        # Controls randomness: lowering results in less random completions.
        # As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become
        # deterministic and repetitive.
        temperature=0.5,

        # The maximum number of tokens to generate. Requests can use up to
        # 2048 tokens shared between prompt and completion.
        max_completion_tokens=1024,

        # Controls diversity via nucleus sampling: 0.5 means half of all
        # likelihood-weighted options are considered.
        top_p=1,

        # A stop sequence is a predefined or user-specified text string that
        # signals an AI to stop generating content, ensuring its responses
        # remain focused and concise. Examples include punctuation marks and
        # markers like "[end]".
        stop=None,

        # If set, partial message deltas will be sent.
        stream=False,
    )

    # Print the completion returned by the LLM.
    print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### [Streaming an Async Chat Completion](#streaming-an-async-chat-completion)

You can combine the benefits of streaming and asynchronous processing by streaming completions asynchronously. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle multiple concurrent conversations.

Python

```
import asyncio

from groq import AsyncGroq


async def main():
    client = AsyncGroq()

    stream = await client.chat.completions.create(
        #
        # Required parameters
        #
        messages=[
            # Set an optional system message. This sets the behavior of the
            # assistant and can be used to provide specific instructions for
            # how it should behave throughout the conversation.
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
            },
            # Set a user message for the assistant to respond to.
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Explain the importance of fast language models",
            }
        ],

        # The language model which will generate the completion.
        model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",

        #
        # Optional parameters
        #

        # Controls randomness: lowering results in less random completions.
        # As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become
        # deterministic and repetitive.
        temperature=0.5,

        # The maximum number of tokens to generate. Requests can use up to
        # 2048 tokens shared between prompt and completion.
        max_completion_tokens=1024,

        # Controls diversity via nucleus sampling: 0.5 means half of all
        # likelihood-weighted options are considered.
        top_p=1,

        # A stop sequence is a predefined or user-specified text string that
        # signals an AI to stop generating content, ensuring its responses
        # remain focused and concise. Examples include punctuation marks and
        # markers like "[end]".
        stop=None,

        # If set, partial message deltas will be sent.
        stream=True,
    )

    # Print the incremental deltas returned by the LLM.
    async for chunk in stream:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## [Structured Outputs and JSON](#structured-outputs-and-json)

# Tool Use

Applications using LLMs become much more powerful when the model can interact with external resources, such as APIs, databases, and the web, to gather dynamic data or to perform actions. **Tool use** (or function calling) is what transforms a language model from a conversational interface into an autonomous agent capable of taking action, accessing real-time information, and solving complex multi-step problems.

This doc starts with a high-level overview of tool use and then dives into the details of how tool use works. If you're already familiar with tool use, you can skip to the [How to Use Tools on the Groq API](#how-to-use-tools-on-the-groq-api) section.

## [How Tool Use Works](#how-tool-use-works)

There are a few important pieces in the tool calling process:

1. A request is made to the model with tool definitions
2. The model returns tool call requests
3. The tool is executed and results are returned to the model
4. The model evaluates the results and continues or completes

Let's break down each step in more detail.

### [1\. Initial Request with Tool Definitions](#1-initial-request-with-tool-definitions)

To use tools, the model must be provided with tool definitions. These tool definitions are in JSON schema format and are passed to the model via the `tools` parameter in the API request.

JSON

```
// Sample request body with tool definitions and messages
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather for a location",
        "parameters": {
          // JSON Schema object
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "City and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
            },
            "unit": {
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a weather assistant. Respond to the user question and use tools if needed to answer the query."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's the weather in San Francisco?" 
    }
  ],
}
```

**Key fields:**

* `name`: Function identifier
* `description`: Helps the model decide when to use this tool
* `parameters`: Function parameters defined as a JSON Schema object. Refer to [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step#introduction-to-json-schema) for schema documentation.

### [2\. Model Returns Tool Call Requests](#2-model-returns-tool-call-requests)

When the model decides to use a tool, it returns structured tool calls in the response. The model returns a `tool_calls` array with the following fields:

JSON

```
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "tool_calls": [{
    "id": "call_abc123",
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "arguments": "{\"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}"
    }
  }]
}
```

**Key fields:**

* `id`: Unique identifier you'll reference when returning results
* `function.name`: Which tool to execute
* `function.arguments`: JSON string of arguments (needs parsing)

### [3\. Tool Execution and Results](#3-tool-execution-and-results)

Application code will then execute the tool and create a new message with the results. This new message is appended to the conversation and sent back to the model.

JSON

```
{
  "role": "tool",
  # must match the `id` from the assistant's `tool_calls`
  "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "content": "{\"temperature\": 72, \"condition\": \"sunny\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}"
}
```

**Key connections:**

* The `tool` message's `tool_call_id` must match the `id` from the assistant's `tool_calls`
* `content` can be any string value. Different tools may return different types of data.
* The updated messages array is then sent back to the model for the next step

### [4\. Model Evaluates Results and Decides Next Steps](#4-model-evaluates-results-and-decides-next-steps)

The model is then provided with the updated messages array:

JSON

```
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What's the weather in San Francisco?"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "tool_calls": [{
      "id": "call_abc123",
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "arguments": "{\"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}"
      }
    }]
  },
  {
    "role": "tool",
    "tool_call_id": "call_abc123",
    "name": "get_weather",
    "content": "{\"temperature\": 72, \"condition\": \"sunny\", \"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}"
  }
]
```

The model then analyzes the tool results and either:

* Returns a final answer (no more `tool_calls`)
* Returns more tool call requests (loop continues)

JSON

```
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "The weather in San Francisco is sunny and 72 degrees Fahrenheit."
}
```

This tool-calling sequence is normally implemented in your application code, but Groq suports a number of ways to call tools server-side which allow your application code to remain simple while still allowing you to use tools.

## [Supported Models](#supported-models)

All models hosted on Groq support tool use, and in general, we recommend the latest models for improved tool use capabilities:

Groq supports three distinct patterns for tool use, each suited for different use cases: Groq built-in tools, remote tool calling via MCP servers, and local tool calling.

### [1\. Groq Built-In Tools](#1-groq-builtin-tools)

Groq maintains a set of pre-built tools like web search, code execution, and browser automation that execute entirely on Groq's infrastructure. These tools require minimal configuration and no tool orchestration on your end. With one API call, you get a capable, real-time AI agent. All tool calls happen in a single API call – when provided configured to have access to built-in tools, the model autonomously calls built-in tools and handles the entire agentic loop internally.

**Ideal for:**

* Drop-in developer experience with zero setup
* Applications requiring the lowest possible latency
* Web search and browsing capabilities
* Safe code execution environments
* Single-call agentic responses

**Supported models:**

* `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini`
* `openai/gpt-oss-20b` and `openai/gpt-oss-120b`

### [2\. Remote Tool Calling with MCP](#2-remote-tool-calling-with-mcp)

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that allows models to connect to and execute external tools. Each MCP server hosts a set of tools, providing endpoints to fetch their definitions and execute them without requiring the end user to implement the underlying tool logic.

Groq supports MCP tool discovery and execution server-side via remote tool calling. Similar to built-in tools, this allows you to use third-party tools with minimal configuration and no tool orchestration on your end. To use remote tools, you provide an MCP server configuration, which includes the MCP server URL and authentication headers. Groq's servers will connect to the MCP server, discover the available tools, pass them to the model, and execute any tools that are called server-side — all in a single API call.

**Ideal for:**

* Standardized integrations (GitHub, databases, external APIs)
* Tools maintained by third parties
* Sharing tools across multiple applications
* Accessing tools without hosting infrastructure

### [3\. Local Tool Calling (Function Calling)](#3-local-tool-calling-function-calling)

If you want the most control over tool execution logic, you can implement local tool calling. To do this, you manually write a set of functions and corresonding tool definitions. The tool definitions are provided to the model at inference time, and the model returns structured tool call requests (example provided above; a JSON object specifying which function to call and what arguments to use). Your application code then executes the function that corresponds to the tool call request locally and sends the results back to the model for the final response.

These functions can connect to external resources such as databases, APIs, and external services, but they are "local" in the sense that they are executed on the same machine as the application code. You can also connect to MCP servers locally to execute tools. This requires implementing code to discover tools from the MCP server, provide them to the model at inference time, routing any tool calls back to the MCP server for execution, and finally returning the results back to the model for the final response.

**Ideal for:**

* Custom business logic
* Internal APIs and databases
* Proprietary workflows
* Fine-grained control over security and execution

### [Parallel Tool Use](#parallel-tool-use)

Many models support **parallel tool use**, where multiple tools can be called simultaneously in a single request. This is crucial for efficient agentic systems:

**Without parallel tool use:**

tool-calling-loop

```
Query: "What's the weather in NYC and LA?"
Call 1: get_weather(location="NYC")      → Wait for result
Call 2: get_weather(location="LA")       → Wait for result
Final response
```

**With parallel tool use:**

tool-calling-loop

```
Query: "What's the weather in NYC and LA?"
Call 1: [get_weather(location="NYC"), get_weather(location="LA")]
Both execute simultaneously → Final response
```

Parallel tool use dramatically reduces latency for queries that require multiple tool calls.

### [Why Groq's Speed Matters](#why-groqs-speed-matters)

Because agentic workflows involve multiple inference calls, using Groq's fast inference can significantly improve the user experience of an agentic application:

* **Single tool call workflow**: 2 inference calls instead of 1 (first call to determine if a tool call is needed, second call to send the tool call results back to the model)
* **Multi-tool workflow**: 3-5+ inference calls
* **Complex agent loops**: 10+ inference calls

With traditional inference speeds of 10-30 tokens/second, multi-tool workflows can feel painfully slow. Groq's inference speed of **300-1,000+ tokens/second** makes these agentic experiences feel **instantaneous**.
